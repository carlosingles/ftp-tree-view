# FTP Tree View package
---
# Current Status Disclaimer
There is currently work to be done on syncing the FTP Tree View with the actual FTP server so then reloads can be performed manually and also so the data set in the FTP Tree View matches the data that's pulled from the connected server.

In a nutshell, this FTP Tree View allows for remote editing with the option of renaming files (renaming MAY be buggy at some points since no sync at the moment)
